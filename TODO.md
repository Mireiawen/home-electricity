# Things to do
* Loop over the notifications in Nordpool instead of expecting there to be exactly 2
* Check that download is complete instead of just waiting
* In general check when things have happened instead of just hoping for the timeouts to work
* Better error handling, especially with robots
* Write README
  * Background
  * Installation
  * Usage
* Do the Magic Mirror plugin itself
